message = "Hello Python world!" #create a variable and assign it a value
print(message) #print the value of message variable onto the console.

message = "Hello Python Crash Course world" #change the value of the already declared variable message

#NAMING CONVENTIONS AND USE OF VARIABLES

#-variables can only have letters, numbers and underscores. they can never start with a number

#-spaces are not allowed in variable names but underscores can be used to seperate words in variable names

#-avoid using python keywords and function names like print as variable names

#-variable names should be descriptive for you and others to understand your code better.
